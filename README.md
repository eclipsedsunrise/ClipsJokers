## Art and Design

Three Jokers were drawn and designed by Imperator Subira off of Reddit! <br>
All others were drawn and designed by me! <br>
Jokers drawn using a template made by [u/VividAwareness4719 on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/VividAwareness4719/) <br>
Thanks to everyone in the discord for providing feedback on art and balance as I dialed things in. <br>

## Programming

The template codebase for this mod was taken from NeatoJokers(https://github.com/neatoqueen/NeatoJokers/releases/latest) <br>
which was written by **Larswijn** and **Lia_Fr0st**. <br>

Everything original to this mod was coded by me, Clips! 
Please assume all the janky code is mine.

## Special Thanks

[Neato](https://www.twitch.tv/neato), whose Artwork and Mod were the original inspiration for this one. 
Your art was a very high bar to aim for, and even though I didn't quite reach it, I learned a lot. <br>

[Roffle](https://www.twitch.tv/roffle), for his very entertaining youtube Balatro Runs.
His breakdown of strategy and balance informed the design of several cards. <br>

**LocalThunk**, obviously. Thanks for making the game! <br>

Everyone who contributed to the SMODS Github Wiki. This mod would not have been possible without your documentation. <br>

The small Gremlin inside of my brain who made me draw silly little playing cards instead of getting sleep.<br>

And you, for playing!
